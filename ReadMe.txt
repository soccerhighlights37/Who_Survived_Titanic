# Titanic Survival Analysis Dashboard (Task-02)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my **Data Science Internship with Prodigy InfoTech**.  
The goal was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Titanic dataset and build an interactive **Power BI Dashboard** to uncover survival patterns.

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualizations)
- Titanic Dataset (CSV)
- Basic Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

---

## 📊 Dashboard Features
1. **KPI Cards**
   - Total Passengers
   - Total Survived
   - Average Age
   - Survival %

2. **Distribution Analysis**
   - Age Distribution (Histogram)
   - Fare Distribution (Histogram)

3. **Categorical Analysis**
   - Survival by Gender
   - Survival by Passenger Class (Pclass)

4. **Relationship Analysis**
   - Survival vs Family Size (Parch/SibSp)

5. **Interactive Slicers**
   - Port of Embarkation (C, Q, S)
   - Number of Parents/Children (Parch)

## 💡 Key Insights
- **Females survived at much higher rates** compared to males.  
- **1st Class passengers had the highest survival rate.**  
- Family size (Parch) influenced survival chances.
